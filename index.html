                        <p>This project documents the data integration process, focusing on the creation of a mediated schema. The main goal was to unify and make consistent data from various sources (such as .csv, .json, .jsonl, .xls file formats), using both manual techniques and the assistance of a Large Language Model (LLM). The work was divided into phases, starting with the extraction of attributes and ending with the final validation, resulting in the creation of a unique dataset based on the obtained mediated schema.
                        Finally, distinct blocking methods were considered in combination with pair-wise matching techniques, which, when compared with a ground-truth generated by us, led to different results regarding precision, recall and accuracy.</p>

                        <p>The project aims to automate the analysis of tables extracted from scientific papers using Large Language Models (LLM). Specifically, the first phase of the project was based on the random selection of 10 papers from an initial pool of around 300 papers previously extracted from Arxiv. Starting from the JSON files of the 10 chosen papers, the second phase focused on finding a methodology as close as possible to an automatic extraction of claims.
                        The required format for the final claims was as follows:  |{Specification, Specification, …}, Measure, Outcome| Specification: |name, value|</p>

                        <p>Variable stars are a fascinating phenomenon in astronomy. This project aims to develop a model capable of classifying different types of variable stars based on characteristics such as brightness, variability, and other metrics derived from observations.
                        This project focuses on the classification of variable stars using machine learning techniques. It utilizes a dataset of astronomical observations to train and test various classification models, the dataset used is PLV_LINEAR.</p>
